            <h2>About Tuoni</h2>
            <p> 
                Tuoni is an exploration, buildcrafting and combat focused RPG-Roguelike, which offers untamed Nordic Wilderness for player to wander in.
                Explore a rich fantasy-world inspired by Finnish legends and the untamed northern wilderness. Tuoni offers a unique blend of old-school RPG-design and atmospheric worldbuilding, where ancient spirits, forgotten creatures, and silent but all-seeing forests accompany your journey through the unknown.
            </p>

            <h2>Features</h2>
            <p>Open World: The North is vast, wild, and slow to reveal its secrets. Trek across howling fens, mossy cliffs, and ancient forests, on your journey to reach land of the dead, Tuoni. There are no set paths, only the ones you carve for yourself.</p>
            <p>Procedural Generation: Wilderness shifts with every journey. Twisting cave systems, forgotten trails, and roaming beasts are reborn with each venture. Key locations stay unchanged, and offer memorable characters and deep lore to uncover.</p>
            <p>Turn-based Combat: Fights are tactical and unforgiving, and rely on a tick-based system. Magic can empower weapons just as easily as it tears through foes. Do you grab an axe, explore powers of fire or become a feared shaman? </p>
            <p>Exploration & Buildcrafting: Tuoni lets you choose your path. Explore where you will, shape your character as you see fit, and decide who lives or dies. High number of skill-trees with different ways of surviving wilderness keep things fresh and encourage exploration. No constraints in class-mixing. </p> 
            <p>Huge enemy variety: Wolves, bears, and other beasts roam the land, some still natural, others hollowed and warped by unknown forces. In the depths of troll-caves, increasingly deadlier and older trolls live, each layer revealing something more ancient and grim. What can you find down there?</p>
            <p>Stylized Experience: Inspired by traditional roguelikes, the aesthetic is unique and retro-leaning.</p>
            <br/>
            <h2>Release Date</h2>
            <p>Tuoni is still in active development, and aims to release in Q2/Q3 of 2026.</p>
